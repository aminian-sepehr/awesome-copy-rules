Copy engineering rules for programmers:D


## Rule 0:
If you are copying a piece of code, copy whole of it!

## Rule 1:
Do not forget where you copy code!!! Always you will need it again!

## Rule 2:
Improve copy engineering socity with copying(!) a rule.

## Rule 3:
While copying, do it right. your copy may be copied sometimes later.

## Rule 4:
If you have 10 days for copying a piece of code , devote 9 days of it for searching.

## Rule 5:
Do not be disappointed. There is always something to copy.

## Rule 6:
Before copying a code , first read all the comments on it (if there was !).

## Rule 7:
Explore new tools! `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`  are not the only tools, for example choose a good [clipboard manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_manager)

## Rule 8:
If you find more than a piece of code use which has lower performance! Because when you want to update your software you could use the one with higher performance!
